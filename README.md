### What Goes Into Making The Programs Run:

(1)**Models**: *The application uses SQLAlchemy to define three models: Restaurant, Pizza, Price, Ingredients and RestaurantPizza. The Restaurant and Pizza models represent restaurants and pizzas, respectively. The RestaurantPizza model represents the many-to-many relationship between restaurants and pizzas, and also includes the price of a specific pizza at a specific restaurant.*

(2)**Validations**: *The application includes validations on the Restaurant and RestaurantPizza models. For example, it ensures that a restaurant's name is unique and less than 50 words in length, and that the price of a pizza at a restaurant is between 1 and 30.*

(3)**Routes**: *The application defines several routes for interacting with the data:
GET /restaurants and GET /pizzas:*return a list of all restaurants or pizzas, respectively.*
GET /restaurants/:*id returns details about a specific restaurant, including the pizzas it serves.*
DELETE /restaurants/:*id deletes a specific restaurant and all associated RestaurantPizza records.*
POST /restaurant_pizzas:*creates a new RestaurantPizza record, associating a pizza with a restaurant at a specific price.*

(4)**Running the server and making requests**: *The application is designed to be run as a server that responds to HTTP requests. You can use a tool like Postman to send these requests and view the responses.*

(5)**Deployment**: *Toughest aspect to the entire process.*

(6)**Error handling**: *The application includes error handling to return appropriate error messages and status codes when things go wrong. For example, if you try to get details for a restaurant that doesn't exist, it will return a "Restaurant not found" error.*

**In summary, this Flask application provides a RESTful API for managing a database of pizza restaurants and pizzas. It includes routes for creating, reading, and deleting data, and it uses SQLAlchemy for data modeling and validation.**
